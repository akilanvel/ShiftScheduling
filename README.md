# ShiftScheduling

This is a Java program that schedules shifts based on employee availabilities and types of employees. The University Emergency Medical Response group has these criteria.

There are three types of employees. The first tpye of employee is called an EMT-2. They have no shift restrictions. The second type of employee is called an FTO. The third type of employee is called an EMT-1. Each EMT-1 will be paired with an FTO and they both will be together for their shift. Shifts run from 8:20 AM to 11:20 PM on all 7 days of the week in three hour intervals. EMT-2s are assigned one shift per week. EMT-1 and FTO pairs are assigned two shifts (each lasting three hours) per week. The program spreads out shifts so that each shift throughout the week si covered by at least one employee, if possible.
